# Mushroom Classifier

This is a simple Kaggle Data Science Project which we will construct a classifier of mushrooms using features provided by kaggle dataset. We have features like a odor, type of rings on mushrooms and shape. Then, we will construct two models, first based on XGboost and second based on Neural Networks like a classifier.

Lets create a road map to our notebook! All Data science project need to build a road map like here.
